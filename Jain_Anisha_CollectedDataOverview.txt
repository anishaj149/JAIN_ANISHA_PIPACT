This is data of my experiment on the effects of humidity and
temperature in a close indoor environment. 

Each .csv file is one data "group," i.e. a level in my experiment
with many observations.

There are 6 groups.

Table of Contents:

group_1_control.csv --> Humidity = 50%
group_2.csv --> Humidity = 60%
group_3.csv --> Humidity = 70%
group_4.csv --> Humidity = 80%
group_5.csv --> Humidity = 90%
group_6.csv --> Humidity = 100%
